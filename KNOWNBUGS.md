Bug Description
1. When switching to the next or previous months and then returning to the month of your last clicked day, the background effect disappears.
2. When clicking anywhere inside the calendar, the background effect disappears.

These issues are a known bug, and I am actively working on a solution. I appreciate your patience, and I aim to resolve it in the upcoming releases.
